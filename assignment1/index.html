		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<img src="assets/images/profilePic.jpg" alt="ProfilePic">
		<p>I'm originally from Missouri, but grew up in Austin, Texas since the age of 10. While growing up, the beautiful water filled landscape of the Texas hill country influenced me to develop a love for outdoor activities such as kayaking and wakeboarding. While growing up if I wasn't outside then I was playing video games with my friends. It was video games that led to my first interaction with coding. When Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 came out, my friends and I decided that we couldn't wait to reach the max level, so instead we bought our way into a prestige lobby. A prestige lobby was an online match in which if you got one kill, or even pushed right on your d-pad, then you would instantly become the max level. I found the prestige lobby to be incredible and wanted to learn how to host one myself. I learned that all it took was a modified xbox and editing just a few files. At the time I had no idea that I was coding, I was just deleting text in a file and replacing it with pasted code I found in tutorials on the subject. I clearly had an interest in tech but as a freshman in highschool didn't see how my modding of call of duty could lead to any type of career. <br><br><br> Fast forward a few years of aimlessly taking basic courses at Austin Community College, and here I am finally realizing my love for problem solving and coding. I am currently attending the University of Texas Coding Bootcamp where I am learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, Node.js, React.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and php frameworks such as laravel. Take a look at my portfolio or Github to see examples of projects that I've built. </p>
